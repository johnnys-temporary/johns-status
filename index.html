<p><h3 style="color:#432a0a;">"hey, making this site feels ridiculous & extra lol, sorry"</p>
<p>"im going to hiatus because even though i really love talking, its my hobby to, i dont want to be harming myself or harming anyone at all."</p>
<p>"i noticed in myself that ive been acting a little odd, That's why I started Talking like This at random occasions, it was a way to lull myself"</p>
<p>"i lull myself often. or stim, whatever you want to call it. its been getting dramatic - spasming energetically in my bedroom just to suddenly stop & stare blankly as if i performed exorcism on myself. im having a hard time. stimming. jumping around, listening to music, <i>digging</i> for music, going crazy. i want to feel comfortable without it costing all of my energy & leading to more overdues."</p>
<p><i>"overdues?,</i> ive been overdue for a while - mostly math but i'll handle that since its mostly missing homework. sci-health-ace task is so difficult because my group gets distracted easily + theyre their own friend group. every time i ask them a question they all wait for the first person to reply, or change the topic completely. i hate group work. it always feels like im the only one who gives a shit & its definitely not good for me mentally. i dont want to be a mean person i just want you to work with me ok?,,. sorry anyway"</p>
<p>"is my crush on here? actually dont tell me i might get embarrassed. i love him to bits. dear viewer can you tell him please, unless theyre here reading right now. then hello deer."</p>
<p>"sorry i couldnt fix up our date.,,.s? ive been lacking sleep, stressed to the point my brain stops functioning, & most importantly i havent been treating me right. how am i going to treat <u>you</u> right? i mean i have been; i love me, its nothing about self hate, ive just been tired, really tired, & i dont want that shift hurting you like it did to younger me where people didnt clarify why they changed tone. i love you"</p>
<p>"i dont want to seem like a violent & <i>opposite of sane </i> person but my darkest wants</h3>
<h5 style="color:#6d8037;">painkiller, alcohol - relapsing in general, sorry.</h5>
<h3 style="color:#432a0a;">have felt like theyre calling me & im afraid that if i take them i'll be different. all i want is to love. i want to remain as coal. i dont want to be pressurized into scientifically impossible diamond."</p>
<p>",,.on discord i wont be active, i'll probably be working - tiktok streaks [sigh. you guys :eye_roll:.] , 1k robux [lol] , messenger [school] . when ive relaxed more i'll log back in to check all the messages thats been left ever since my mini-break."</h3></p>
